# Roam Lisbon Theme

*NOTE: This theme is currently very "work in progress". Please check back often for updates.*

This is a simple Roam Research theme with 3 main goals:

1. To give a soft, enjoyable color scheme that vaguely reminds users of Lisbon, Portugal (one of my favorite cities).
2. To use aesthetically enjoyable color to make identifying links, block and page references, and other content easier (vs. just shades of gray).
3. To make using some advanced Roam features, like Kanban boards or Pomodoro timers, a bit closer to what you might expect from software purpose built for the use case.

TODO:
- [x] Initial base styling for links, page and block references, fonts and titles
- [x] Simple themeing for Kanban boards, give them closer to a Notion or Trello vibe
- [ ] Style the pomodoro to be larger and use Lisbon-esque coloring
- [ ] Style the left sidebar
- [ ] Style the top toolbar icon buttons
- [ ] Refine the color palette to be more Lisbon-ish
